3/5/19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"This complaint dates back to last 34/34/3434 during a loan modification which was done with 3434 ( Account # 3434 ) my previous loan servicer this was after a 2 month forbearance after Hurricane Irma. They had indicated a shortage to my escrow account in the loan modification documents. I was provided different information every time I spoke on the phone with a 3434   representative. One would say I had an overage, others would say I had a shortage. The modification documents indicated at {$1900.00} shortage. I called, I emailed and wrote letters, I requested a Escrow review of my account in 3434 and 3434 and was told one would be done. They kept delaying and I finally had to sign the Modification documents on 34/34/3434 under duress otherwise the Modification would be withdrawn. No review of my escrow was ever done by 3434, I discovered what appears to be an error when I reviewed the two Escrow Disclosure statements from 3434 for 3434 and 3434. The Escrow balance for 34/34/3434 shows an actual escrow balance of {$2200.00}, the next statement shows a 3434 actual balance for 3434, a difference of 3434 when only 3434 should have been withdrawn from this account to pay for the monthly mortgage insurance. I have recently contacted by phone and email to 3434 and they have not responded. 

In 34/34/3434 my loan servicing was transferred to Mr Cooper ( Formerly Nationstar Mortgage. ) ( Account # 3434 ). Mr Cooper did do a escrow analysis in 3434 of 3434. That analysis was completely mishandled and they indicate a shortage of 3434 in my account. Even though my account is currently at a 3434 deficit as of 34/34/3434. Their major errors was their analysis to my Hazard insurance and Morgage insurance. They indicated the Hazard insurance was 3434 last year ( when it was actually 3434 ) and this year the correct amount of 3434. The Mortgage insurance they again misquoted last year at 3434 ( the actual was 3434 ) and listed this year the correct amount at 3434 so they are showing a difference from last year to this year of 3434 increase. This is totally wrong. They are demanding the difference be paid in a lump sum or have my monthly payment increased to cover the shortage over a year period. I have contacted Mr Cooper by phone on  34/34/3434 and was told someone would look at it but no one from their Escrow will call, just an email. I have also sent a letter stating the error. The new charges will be taking effect in 3434 so something needs to happen quickly. The simple facts are that my Hazard insurance has gone down from 3434 to 3434. My taxes did go up from 3434 to 3434, so the net effect of the two is only 3434. I am already paying one shortage based on 3434 miscalculation and that was to be spread out over 5 years. 
I want both 3434 and Mr Copper to correct the errors made to my escrow account and have 3434 send the deficiency to Mr Cooper post haste. I want Mr Cooper to revise the shortage based on all of this information.

4/7/20,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I received an email from a 3434 3434 along with a single page attached on 34/34/3434. The email read The final pay off amount for 3434, 3434 will be {$86000.00} This information is provided by 3434 3434 on 3434. It was emailed from 3434. The subject line read Re : 3434 3434 3434 ( Payoff amount for 3434 and insurance info.The insurance info was a single page showing coverage of {$77000.00} on a single story dwelling from a 3434 34343434 3434 listing my home address and 3434 3434, 3434 3434 , as registered agent. 3434 3434 was the insured. I responded to that email disagreeing with the amount and asked for some sort of statement of accounting because 3434 3434 was asking for more than the {$85000.00} financed and I had made payments for 5 years and 7 months consecutively. She responded with just saying no she was correct. On or around 3434 3434, 3434 3434 3434 3434 3434 Attorney In Fact for a 3434 3434 mailed me a Notice of substitute trustee sale The notice had a sale date of 3434 3434, 3434 A date of 34/34/3434 An amount of {$95000.00} Borrower 3434 3434 3434 3434 3434 Collateral : All of Debtors interest in the real property legal described as : 3434 3434 3434  3434 3434 3434 3434  3434 3434 according to the map and plat there of recorded in the Deed Anns Plat Records 3434 County , Texas . The Note section is blank. This is dated 34/34/3434 and has a file stamp of 34/34/3434 in 3434 County Records. 3434 3434 never lended me any money. I was the only person providing money in the purchase of my home. I was in a TREC   contract with 3434 3434 for my home. It was already signed by us both for the home {$85000.00} financed for 360 months no balloon payment ; until I received 34/34/3434 closing documents showing a balloon payment due 3434 3434, payments of {$850.00} every month/ {$600.00} being the house payment and the other being taxes. I am wanting to see the bank statements and escrow accounting for the time period of 34/34/3434 thru 3434, 3434 and the payment records for taxes, and all transfer records. And the proof that 3434 3434 has showing {$95000.00} going from her hand to mine. I want to see the substitute trustee recorded appointment and I want to see proof of 3434 3434 identity. I want to see the accounting for the down payment made on the property and proof she owned the property when she sold it to me. 
When I obtained legal representation and stopped the sale date, another debt collection letter came dated 34/34/3434 for a sale date of 34/34/3434. This notice contains all the same information as the previous notice except it is listing 3434 3434 name first above 3434 3434 3434 3434 Attorney in fact at 3434 3434 3434 3434 3434 in 3434 3434 , Texas . After firing the first attorney hired after the discovery of {$21000.00} in receipts missing from my receipts of payments to 3434 3434 a new hired attorney chose to conspire with 3434 3434 3434 3434 and 3434 3434 and in the printed emails left in my file that were my attorney and 3434 3434 Attorney planning and executing the sale of my home they had agreed on the figures that 3434 will have the HUD 1 payoff Mr Cooper and 3434 loans paid in full their ( your, 3434 3434 3434 3434 ) further states there is a first and second on this property Mr Cooper total payoff by 3434 3434 {$47000.00} 3434 3434 3434 payoff is {$13000.00} subtotal {$60000.00} BUT again there is language of a loan between 3434 and I in an amount said to be {$78000.00} and Mr. 3434 took the liberty of adding Attorney fees of {$5000.00} making a total of {$83000.00} these documents were emailed back and forth plan discussed of running it through the uncontested docket, signed by a judge, filed in the court records, being fully executed. But I never received any documentation of this sale. I am requesting / demanding the pay off accounting and statements and a copy of the HUD1.

Now I am needing to have the documentation and explanation of how my home was sold, if it wasnt is it fraud on the court? And AGAIN I receive another notice of substitute trustee sale dated 34/34/3434 this time the amounts are base amount due as maturity : {$88000.00} / unpaid principle past maturity ( 18 % ) {$34000.00} / subtotal {$120000.00} / Attorney Fees 3434 / Cost {$120.00} / Total due 34/34/3434 {$130000.00} It continues to read : please contact 3434 3434 3434 3434 for current payoff instructions at my address above please be advised if this payment is not received by 3434 the mortgagee will exercise the rights under the loan documents and foreclose the loan at public sale, Tuesday, 3434, 3434 at 3434. In accordance with the federal and Texas laws regarding fair debt debt collections unless you within thirty days after receipt of this notice, dispute the validity of the debt set forth above or any portionhereof the indebtedness will be assumed to be valid. This notice is signed by 3434 3434 3434 3434 Attorney for 3434 3434. Now I want to know how you, 3434 3434 3434 or and 3434 3434 can act as an Attorney in fact and harass me for months, years inducing lawsuits when an attorney in fact is not allowed to handle assets held in trust? How can you impose a debt on me of {$130000.00} and state you will respond to my letter of validation when you did not. Mailing me copies of public record court papers and passed made up accounting graphs from your home computer is not accounting. I want to see the reasoning on how you decided I owed this last mentioned notice and the removal of trustee documents recorded. You stated in this debt collection letter you would reveal the original creaditor upon my request and you did not.I mailed to you by certified letter and I faxed you the same validation letter but you not 3434 3434 responded until I received again a substitute trustee sale notice this time 2 in the same envelope? dated 34/34/3434 And 3434 3434, 3434 stating I owe {$130000.00} and contains debt collection language but you are threatening to sell my home ...., you already did once. On 34/34/3434 you sold my home to 3434 3434 for a credit bid of {$88000.00}.? I want all tax certificates and the deed of trust back I want all 3434 3434 3434 accounting and I want copies of all the escrow account. I want copies of proof you owned my home when you sold it to me 3434 3434, 3434. 
I demand documented proof that you obtained a legal confessed judgement by me. I demand documentation of the mortgage loan you have repeatedly made demands for payment of and of the investment contract you are holding / have held me liable for that I am not a party that is the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Statue of Frauds was made to prevent the very thing you have been doing to me. See UCC at 2-201. You have made me an undisclosed third party to a loan modification ; to a contract I am not a party to. This is why you have never been able to show my payments going to a servicing company you are sending them as cash flow to the investors. You kept using the term mortgage in your debt collection letters but a note is a security as you know, this was undisclosed to me along with a disclaimer that was supposed to be in the credit application under Title 16 16 car 433.2 which says the buyer/seller takes it subject to all defenses and claims that the buyer could assert against any transferee or any buyer who buys it. But you Took it out of the loan application. So there is no holder in due course meaning you take it subject to my claims and defenses I am claiming recoupment under UCC 3-305 under UCC 3-306 I am encoring my proprietary and possession art and property interest in the note and its proceds. Also I am encoring my right to rescind the endorsement on the note. The rider 3434 3434 made the wrap around deed of trust with modifies the conditions of payment and supplements and governs the promissory note. UCC 3-106 ( D ) it cant be negotiated instrument if it is subject or governed by extraneous documents outside the promissory note and you made it subject to an adjustable rate Ryder and a deed of trust. You can not collect an alleged debt on what you call a mortgage and sell someones property when it is not a note or a negotiable interest. It has a maturity longer than nine months making it a security. I am encoring my right to claim under UCC 3-306 the proceeds, rescuind the negotiation, and am claiming my possessionary and property right in the proceeds in the investment contract. I demand a quick response with my demands met as they are rightfully mine and more than owed to me.",,NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE,TX,78223,Consent provided,Web,4/9/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3595729

11/15/19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"We have already tried to contact the company with the following complaint 3 times using different avenues. In the most recent email sent, we requested that they contact us to at least acknowledge that the complaint was received. We have gotten no responses since the complaint was first filed three weeks ago. The text of the submitted complaint follows. 

To whom it may concern : We are writing to submit a formal complaint regarding the poor service that we received while working with 3434 3434 3434/Closing Mark Home Loan. We are strongly considering submitting a formal complaint to the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and any similar state agency in Colorado and/or California, as we feel that there were instances that pushed the boundaries of acceptable and, possible, legal behavior. 
The entire loan process with this company, from start to finish, has been unprofessional at best to downright deceptive and, potentially, life-impacting. We have been forgotten, lied to, and put into stressful situations that, frankly, should never happen. We have been through multiple account officers and underwriters, been asked to submit documents multiple times, been told falsehoods, and, upon completing closing on 34/34/3434, we received letters that appeared to be informing us that we had been denied for the loan that we closed on. 
The following is a summarized narrative of the timeline from starting the prequalification process to closing on the mortgage. This timeline has been compiled based upon timestamped communication ( both written and digital ). 
We started this journey in 34/34/2019, upon starting the prequalification process. We submitted the requested information to 3434 3434 3434 ( herein after 3434 )  and promptly received a response on 34/34/3434. At that time, we received an initial workbook which showed us the expected loan amount, down payment amount, fees, etc. The individual that we started with was extremely responsive and helpful, answering any of our questions promptly and clearly. 
We toured the community and decided that it was a good fit for us. At that time, we were given the option of looking for outside financing options or pursuing financing with the related company, 3434 ; the related financing came with builder incentives. At no point were we pressured by the sales team at 3434 to go with 3434. However, as we had already started the prequalification process ( and the subsequent hard hit to our credit scores ) and because of the very good service we had received to date, as well as the healthy builder incentive, we signed the sales contract with the commitment to pursue the mortgage through 3434. The contract was completed on 34/34/3434, following a discussion with both the sales team at 3434 and the 3434 representative. 
On 34/34/3434 ( a Saturday ), we reached out to the 3434 representative to see what the next financing steps would be, as the sales team indicated that the mortgage company would reach out to us. The next day ( a Sunday ), the 3434 representative informed us that he would be running an automated approval and would reach out if he needed additional documents. We took this to mean that our application was complete enough to start the clock and was in process. At this point, we had not been told that additional documents would be required to complete our application, just that there may be a need for additional documentation. 
We did not hear back from the 3434 representative after that point. On 34/34/3434 ( a Saturday, nearly two full calendar weeks from last contact ), we reached out to the 3434 representative again. By 34/34/3434 ( Wednesday ), we emailed the 3434 sales team for assistance ; they referred us to the president of the mortgage company. We were informed, by the president of the company, that the 3434 representative that had been handling our application had abruptly left 3434 and that our application had not been passed onto another case manager/loan officer. By that time, our required loan approval date had passed ; this date was stipulated in our sales contract. 
We were connected with a new 3434 representative ( herein after referred to as new 3434 representative or loan officer ) who informed us via email that our application was incomplete and that nothing had been processed in the intervening time. Again, we had been under the impression that our application was complete and in process since mid-3434. At that point, again, nearly two weeks had passed, and we did not receive a formal notification of incompleteness. 
During the subsequent document collection period, the loan officer asked we could put down another half percent, which would increase our down payment to 3.5 % of the sales price. We agreed that we could afford the extra 0.5 %, but asked if she was considering an FHA loan. She informed us that she was looking at that option. At that point, we stated that we did not want to pursue an FHA loan, but said that we would consider it if we could see all the financing options that she could offer us. We asked that we be provided with a worksheet showing all the offerings that we could qualify for, so that we could pick the option that best matched our needs. We never received a product comparison worksheet despite the written request. Additionally, we did not receive an updated worksheet showing our expected costs at this time. 

Subsequently, as we were loading additional documents into the 3434 portal when we noticed that we had a loan details section available. We opened that section of the webpage and saw that our loan had been started under an FHA program, despite the fact that we had told our loan officer that we did not want an FHA loan and despite the fact that we had not been given a worksheet showing our product options. We communicated to the loan officer that we emphatically did not want the FHA loan, as the fees associated with the loan would negate any benefit from going with 3434, based upon the builder incentives. Additionally, both of us have strong credit scores and did not need the credit support to qualify for a mortgage. Instead of giving us a workbook showing us our different financing options, the loan officer changed the product type for the mortgage to a 3434  3434  conventional loan. Again, at no point were we allowed to select our product type ( or informed that 3434 only offered a limited product selection ). We were not given the information needed to make an informed decision. 

On 34/34/3434, we received the first set of loan disclosure documents ; we were not talked through our product choices at this point. We promptly signed the loan disclosures, after saving a copy and reviewing in detail. At this point, we received our first estimate ( aside from the prequalification estimate provided in 3434 ) that showed our expected loan costs, rate, fees, etc. This information was not provided ahead of time and we were informed that we had only 72 hours to sign the documents. We were not given options on product type or any other factor. Additionally, we were not offered any assistance in understanding the documents that we were given or any help working through the legalese. 

It should be noted that we were informed, only by the disclosures, that the PMI would not be cancellable due to rising home values. At the outset, the original 3434  representative implied ( though, notably, did not explicitly state ), that the home could be reappraised after a period of time and the new value used for the LTV calculation. Under the subsequent disclosures, it was apparent that the PMI could only cancellable via loan payments compared to the original appraised value at closing. While not a major issue, it is notable because it is contradictory to information that we had at outset. 

On 34/34/3434, we received an automated email informing us that we had updated disclosures to sign. The email did not indicate what the changes were, nor did the loan officer notify us at any point that changes had been made. Upon reviewing the disclosures, the changes were the addition of a TILA form ( that we did not receive in our original packet ), an additional {$200.00} fee, and the removal of our {$5000.00} earnest money deposit. As a result, our updated disclosures indicated that we would owe an additional {$5000.00} in cash for our down payment at closing.

We reached out the same date to the loan officer and received a response that equated to her not knowing what was going on. Upon further research, she informed us that she wasnt sure why the earnest money deposit was removed and that she would make sure that we would get updated documents showing the amount. We were told to be confident that the credit would be given at closing. 

On 34/34/3434, we were introduced via email to a loan processor ( herein after loan processor or underwriter ; this introduction came directly from the loan processor and the loan officer was not involved in the introduction. At this time, the loan processor stated that our loan was conditionally approved, dependent upon two document lists. One list was to be provided as soon as possible, while the other was due within 60 days of closing. At this point, we were at about a month and a half out from the point at which we had been originally led to believe that our application was complete.

Many of the documents requested at this time had already been submitted as part of our original loan package or the subsequent package initiated by the loan officer. We had to resend many of the documents and enter them onto an online portal. 

It should be noted, at this point, we sent images ( pictures ) of several of the documents to the loan processor. This was not an issue and she did not request that the documents be scanned or otherwise in a different format. 

On 34/34/3434, we began reaching out to the loan officer to get information for the mortgagee clause, as our insurance agent was requesting it before he could start the formal application and estimate process on his side. The next day, we were informed that a new loan processor ( different from the current underwriter ) would provide that information to our agent. 

On 34/34/3434, we reached out to the loan processor, as we had not heard from her since we submitted our documents ( largely completed in 3434 ). On 34/34/3434, she responded and said that she received all our documents that that everything looks good at this time. She said that she would reach out closer to closing, but did not state why. 

On 34/34/3434, we received an email from the loan officer informing us that 3434 had acquired Closing Mark Home Loans ( herein after CMHL ) and that our mortgage application would be acquired by CMHL. The email stated that our mortgage would be redisclosed and that we would need to sign updated disclosures. 

On 34/34/3434, we received a notification from CMHL stating that the 3434 mortgage application had been migrated to the new platform. We received new loan disclosures at that time. 

The 34/34/3434 letter informed us that we would be receiving an updated conditional approval. This is a month after we had originally been conditionally approved. The loan officer did not reach out to explain that a new application had been started on the new platform, hence the approval process was started over entirely. The document informed us that our application was started 34/34/3434, though it was not explicitly made clear that it was a completely new loan application and not just a formality due to the new system. 

On 34/34/3434, we received the formal scheduling request for closing, via Closing Mark Settlement Services. While this was scheduled, we had not yet received a formal approval, final disclosures, or closing instructions. 

On 34/34/3434, we received 3 options for the interest rate lock. The option sheet was sent only with instructions to look at Options 1, 2 and 3, with no explanation for the calculations, differences, or any other factors. Upon reviewing them, the only option that we could follow the math on was Option 3. Given the previous difficulties in obtaining information from the loan officer, we decided to lock on the option that we could follow. Based on our math, the other two options did not appear to conform to standard amortization at the listed interest rates, but, again, we could not follow the math. 

On 34/34/3434, we received our updated disclosures for the interest rate lock. This disclosure, like previous disclosures, did not have any charge for points. 

On 34/34/3434, we received an email from the president of the mortgage company. This email informed us that 3434 was legally required to close out the application and that we would soon be receiving a notice from 3434  that would show that 3434  no longer had an active application in the system for us ; the email stated that the communication that we would receive could include language stated that the application was denied, but that it would not impact our ongoing application with CMHL. 

On 34/34/3434, we received a Changed Circumstance letter. This letter added a {$770.00} fee, amounting to 0.25 % of the loan amount, as points, as part of the origination costs. This fee was not explained to us. The letter stated that it was due to the credit report/credit score and credit report/mortgage insurance. 

On 34/34/3434, we received an email titled 3434/3434 3434 3434 Conditional Loan Approval. This email included a list of new documents to provide, including new disclosures, new bank statements, new paystubs, insurance quote, and college transcripts. It should be noted that we were told, in the body of the email, that the documents needed to be provided asap. At this point, we were not offered a secure way to send our documents. We could email them back to the loan processor directly or fax them. 

At this point, we were also informed that we could not send pictures of documents to the loan processor, despite having been able to send images previously. While navigable, this put a fair amount of undue pressure on us, as we had to find a way to scan our documents to be able to send them via email. We also found that we had a significant amount of pressure from the loan processor to provide the documents quickly On 34/34/3434, we received disclosures to sign. On 34/34/3434, we emailed the loan officer and asked if the disclosures were the final set and if the listed cash to close amount was the amount we needed to get our cashiers check for closing. We were informed that the disclosures given were the final set. 

The 34/34/3434 documents additionally included a waiver for the receipt of the appraisal within the timing required by ECOA section 1002.14 ( a ) ( 1 ). 

On 34/34/3434, we received the appraisal on the property. This property appraisal had been completed on 34/34/3434. 

On 34/34/3434, we emailed our loan officer to ask about what name to put on the cashiers check for closing, as we never received closing instructions. While this email was sent on a Saturday, we had previously received prompt responses from all parties, even on weekends. We had no reason to believe that we would not hear back prior to closing on 34/34/3434. 

We received no further communication from the mortgage company, nor any of its agents, prior to closing. 

On 34/34/3434, we closed on the mortgage. Our appointment to close was at 3434. We arrived at approximately 3434, as our previous meeting for the day had ended more quickly than expected. We were prepared to wait until 3434. Our closing agent came out at around 3434 and told us that our application had not yet been approved by CMHL and that she was, as a result, still, waiting for documents. She also informed us that she had not yet received the final closing disclosure and that, as a result, our cash to close amount had not yet ben finalized. 

At about 3434, our closing agent informed us that she had received several closing disclosures for our application that day. She then stated that the final closing amount had been set by CMHL, as she had confirmed the most recent disclosure with the wire processor. We were short on our original check ( which was stated as the final amount, as previously noted ) and were forced to go back to our bank. We had to come up with about {$800.00} on the spot to be able to close. At this point, our closing documents were not yet available. 

We signed our documents at our 3434 PM on 34/34/3434. We waited at the settlement office until nearly 3434 3434 for the final wire to be sent by the processing agent. We were given no explanation for the significant wait. 

After closing, we returned to our then-current residence for the night. We checked our mail. We found two letters which were mailed to us ( one for each of us ), which stated that our loan had been denied. The letters were dated 34/34/3434, but had not been mailed and post-marked until 34/34/3434. These letters were related to the hand-off from 3434 to CMHL. As previously noted, we had been told in 3434 that we may receive a formal denial letter, due to the new application being opened. As given by the discrepancy between the letter and postmark dates, it appears that these letters were held back for some reason. The reason was not given to us at any point in the application process. 

The following day, 34/34/3434, we received an email from our loan officer apologizing for the delay in response to our question regarding our closing and a statement that she hoped our closing went okay. No comments were included regarding the fact that our loan had not been approved for the day of closing. We did not respond. 

In summary, the entire process was fraught and full of miscommunications and a lack of communication. Our grievances are summarized below : Our application was forgotten by the mortgage company, as the original representative left and nobody picked up his caseload. 
Our application was implied to have been complete and in process with the original representative. 
o At no point did we receive a formal notice of incompleteness, despite ongoing requests for information over several months. 
o We were not given a complete checklist of all the information that we would need to provide throughout the life of the application and approval process. 
We were not given product comparisons between available options, despite multiple requests for such information. 
We were originally put into a product type that we explicitly stated that we did not want. 
o While we do not know the details of the 3434/CMHL compensation structure, we have been informed by multiple individuals from outside financial institutions that FHA loans often generate a larger incentive fee for the loan officer. We believe that this could be the reason for the initial assignment.

We were given contradictory information throughout the process. This includes receiving documents which did not include {$5000.00} in cash we had already paid ; while this was resolved, this issue was never explained to us.

We were not given explanations for multiple adjustments and changes to fees and amounts through out the process.

o Our loan officer did not make any attempt to explain any of the forms, procedures, or documents that we received. We were forced to make our best attempt at understanding the files that we had to sign. 
o When setting our rate lock, the loan officer did not explain the difference between the given options. As previously stated, two of the options did not mathematically calculate to the payments given.

o We are better informed than most consumers, as one of us works for a commercial bank. Even then, we had trouble with some of the documents and it is baffling that we received no guidance from the loan officer.

We were denied a secure way to send documents to the loan processor.

o Additionally, a format which had previously been acceptable for files, was no longer acceptable. We were not given an explanation for this discrepancy. 
We were not given closing instructions. When we reached out for instructions ( admitted at the 11th hour ), we did not receive a response. This is out of line with prior behavior, as we had previously received prompt communication even outside of normal business hours. 
o The response from the lender was given a business day after our closing. It should be noted that this response did not include any of the requested information. 
Our loan was not approved prior to the day of our closing and, in actuality, we had to wait for the application to be approved and for documents to be prepared and sent to our closing agent. 
o While we are not sure of the industry standard for loan approvals and preparation of loan documents for mortgages, it does not seem unreasonable to expect that the process should be completed well prior to the day of closing. 
o This caused a significant amount of personal stress, as our closing agent could not give us an expected timeline. We were left unaware of if we were going to be able to close on our scheduled date or if we would need to be rescheduled. 
This is significant, as we had already made arrangements for our moving process, including cancelling our lease with our prior residence, booking and prepaying for moving equipment, and taking time off from work ( including taking time for the day of closing itself ). 
We received a formal loan denial after our closing, with the denial letters being sent on 34/34/3434. Given that 34/34/3434 was a holiday, it seems likely that the letters were sent so as to not be received until after closing. 
o The letters were dated 34/34/3434, which means that the letters were held back for well over a month. While we are not sure on the required disclosure timelines for consumer loans, we have been informed that it is often 10 days from the decision date.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 



Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 


2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 


3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 


4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 


5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 


6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,32734,Consent provided,Web,10/24/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3416197
2/20/19,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"Last year, we had two significant hailstorms, and my house required substantial repairs. My insurance company paid for the repairs but required my mortgage company to co-sign on my check. I sent them three checks valued at : {$1400.00}, {$2800.00}, and {$23000.00}. They withheld 10 % of the total value of my claim ( {$4700.00} ) until the work was 90 % complete. They must inspect all work before they disperse portions of your insurance check. Several of my fellow soldiers on 3434 3434 warned me that this company was taking their money and placing it an interest-bearing account then refusing to disperse the money when the work was complete. 
On 34/34/2019, we contacted LoanCare to get an inspector to my home. They failed to send an inspector for nearly two months and refused to allow me to speak to a supervisor.

1/17/19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I have been trying to get my Private Mortgage Insurance Removed from my mortgage since 34/34/3434 when my mortgage dropped below 80 % loan to value. Last year my mortgage was sold from 3434 3434  ( Under mortgage # 3434 ) to Ditech Mortgage ( account # 3434 ). I reached out to Ditech via a email ( after being told to do so via phone representative ) request to remove my PMI on mortgage on 34/34/3434 and received no response at all from them, I even checked my junk box and nothing was there. My mortgage papers that I signed state an "" Automatic Termination of PMI '' that states once my loan is below 78 % loan to value PMI will automatically terminate ( I have attached this document ). I reached out again today on 34/34/3434 to make this request via phone and was told initially to send the request that I already sent it too. I asked to speak with a supervisor and after being put on hold for about 30 minutes, I finally spoke to one. They told me that my loan to value must be under 70 % loan to value and that was their policy. After reading this document to the supervisor, I was told that "" they don't have that document on file ''. She ( 3434 3434 ) sent me a link to send her the form I have. I did so and just told me that I'll be hearing from them in 7-10 business days. Given their past history, I highly doubt that I will hear from them. I did mention to the supervisor and ask her why they weren't staying compliant to the homeowners protection act and she said nothing. From my understand this act requires mortgage companies to drop off PMI once loans are below 78 % LTV and the loan is current. I qualify for both of those items and don't understand why this is such a difficult task.",Company believes complaint represents an opportunity for improvement to better serve consumers,Ditech Financial LLC,TX,78134,Consent provided,Web,1/17/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3126960

I attempted to dispute and resolve this issue directly with the Credit Reporting Agencies with no success. 
I am about to apply for a new home mortgage loan and before I do that I would like to ensure that this derogatory line-item is permanently removed from my file with all 3 major credit reporting agencies. 
I am reaching out to CFPB to help me solve satisfactorily this issue.

My name is 3434 3434 and I was 3434 yrs old at the time and a college student. My mom & I sat down as I returned from college and pulled my credit report. Discovered after pulling the Free Annual Credit Report that another person, 3434 3434  3434, and a car loan & credit card that were not mine were on my credit report. It should be noted it was only on 3434. We contacted 3434 & Wells Fargo bank to report the fraudulent accounts. They did confirm it was my SS # on file but with someone elses name, DOB, and address. We filled out fraud forms, send police report number, and copies of credit reports. On 34/34/3434 & 34/34/3434 I received letters from both Wells Fargo & 3434 stating it was discovered to be identity theft and they would have the 3 credit bureaus remove from my credit file. I also placed a freeze on my credit files. 

On 34/34/3434 I received a few voicemails from SS office stating my identity may have been compromised yet again. I pulled credit reports again and was shocked to see 3434  is reporting my file as 3434 3434 3434, his DOB, Addresses, 3434 3434 is running inquiries ( I dont have ), Wells Fargo credit card is showing closed as of 34/34/3434, last payment 34/34/3434, shows consumer disputes, and last reported 34/34/3434. None of this is mine and was to be removed. 

This person is clearly using my SS # according to 3434 & Wells Fargo. 3434 did their job and removed it for Fraud. Wells Fargo has not. How did a large national bank such as Wells Fargo allow someone to open a credit card in my name without the proper verification. Clearly the other persons name and DOB ( 34/34/3434 ) does not match my SS #. Where is the verification on that? They allowed someone to use falsified documents and did not follow verification procedures. I am only 3434 yrs old and have been a victim of identity theft by 2 large companies.

4/15/20,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"I am in the 3434  industry and have been deeply affected by the Coronavirus, likely more than most. I am a 3434 3434 as a 3434 34343434 and 3434. I have lost 4 months of work and have even been rescheduling in the Fall and losing my remaining good Saturdays for the year. So I will not be making up that money. I filed for unemployment, but because I am 3434 and work in 2 states ( 3434 3434 area strattles state line ), I was told I had to call in. The call line sends you to a machine which hangs up on you after directing you back online because they are swamped. So I said I only work in Kansas in order to submit it, but no response or check yet. 

We have 3434  kids and a new home we bought in 3434 of 2019. Our mortgage company is Mr. Cooper. We have missed 2 payments of roughly {$1800.00} each, 3434 and 3434, so far. I have tried calling, but they also have an automated message directing you back to online and hanging up afterward. But then I discover the only option is a forbearance, admittedly warning I may be disqualified from any stimulus or other aid if I fill it out. On top of that, they say quite sternly 3434 and repeated bluntly by the CEO in a video ) that it is NOT an extension of the life of the loan, but rather a normal extension, requiring a lump sum at the end of the 90 days. As if anyone is saving money right now and able to pay MORE when this nightmare is over! Thats illogical. It is mentioned that payment plans could be made, but this is not what you agree to in the application and it is so arbitrary it is unknown exactly what they could force you to do after agreeing to this form. This seems unwise to enter into. So for these terms, and the threat of not getting aid, I chose not to fill this out. I did however email them explaining this. I have not heard back and they are still not taking calls. 

We can not lose our home. And we can not pay a higher monthly payment. We are scared and dont know how to fix this. Meanwhile, the days are passing by and notices are flooding in. We have been able to pay all our other bills, but that will end this month if unemployment or a stimulus doesnt come soon. 

If anyone can encourage mortgage companies to extend the life of loans, it would help us immensely. I can only imagine how many people are being hurt by filling out this forbearance, which essentially gives zero aid, and only allows for a little time to then make their account current all at once, without any backpay to do so. It seems dishonest and taking advantage of many people forced to choose this only option. They should be held accountable for making things worse on hurting people everywhere.",,NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE,KS,,Consent provided,Web,4/15/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3607061

2/20/19,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Need information about your loan balance or loan terms,"My original lender was 3434 3434 3434 ; this loan was considered a private loan that my parents took out to pay for my college education. 3434 3434 3434 had switched servicers to 3434 3434. The original promissory note I have, shows my father as applicant # 1/borrower, my mother as applicant # 2/co-borrower, and myself as student. This loan originated in 34/34/3434. My father and I share the same name and I feel that has added confusion. My father always made the payments on this loan, as well as, collected tax documents and deductions on this loan, as the borrower. In 34/34/3434, my father passed away from 3434. My mother contacted 3434 and she was told about loan forgiveness. She submitted my fathers death certificate and she waited 32 days for an answer. Unfortunately, they did not approve the loan for forgiveness. Instead, 3434 has switched me, from student, to borrower and my mother stays as co-borrower. How did I go from being a student on a promissory note, to now the sole borrower? I have called 3434, and it has been unsuccessful. I have requested documents including the denial letter stating why the loan wasnt forgiven as a result of my father 's death, the promissory note they have on file, as well as the loan terms indicating that I am now legally responsible for this loan. I have had no success in retrieving these documents. I have been told that I am not entitled to these documents from 3434 and to contact 3434 3434 3434 for the promissory note. I was told by a 3434 representative that the promissory note they have on file is not legible and she couldnt confirm who was supposed to be borrower/co-borrower. I have contacted 3434 3434 3434, for a copy of the promissory note, by email. I was told by 3434 3434 3434 that they do not have the promissory note and to refer to 3434 copy. I have responded to their initial email, requesting more information and they have not responded. There is no contact information for 3434 3434 3434, just an email address. I am doubtful of the information I have been given. I feel I should be entitled to a copy of the denial letter, as well as a legible copy of the promissory note. I would also like to see a copy of the loan terms indicating how I went from being a student, to now the main borrower. I want documentation, and feel it is my consumer right, to have proof that 3434 has that ability to change borrowers and to choose who is made responsible. Though Im hopeful for your timely response and subsequent resolution of my issues, Im fully aware of the 'not-so-positive ' reviews/feedback given to 3434 3434 and, therefore, will be prepared to submit additional complaints to the 3434 3434 3434 , and the Ohio Attorney General.",,"Nelnet, Inc.",OH,,Consent provided,Web,2/25/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3156880
